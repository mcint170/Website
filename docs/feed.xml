If you are seeing this
now, welcome ðŸ˜ƒ I hope you find the content here somewhat enjoyable or atleast 
a tad bit interesting. If you are seeing this relatively recently to posting, 
please come back later and I hope to be a little more established here and have more
posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Little Disclaimer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I am just throwing this out here now, please be aware that I am no HTML or Website 
building Guru (well atleast not at this leg in the game). This is my first ever 
dive into HTML / CSS / Jekyll, so if you see some bug, or something is not quite 
right, please feel free to reach out to me and I can try to do my best to address the problem!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-whats-my-big-plan&quot;&gt;So whatâ€™s my big plan?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My plans are to use this website as a basis for my Personal / Data Science journey.
The hopes is that I can use these posts to show my interests in Data Science and 
Science in general. Hopefully along the way, I can begin to tailor myself as an
expert in some sort of sub-discipline. For now I will remain as open-minded and
free going as I can. If anything, this will be good practice in documenting my
path and act as a centeralized place to express my ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize that possibly this could also serve as a place to document posts I create
elsewhere. These could be things like Twitter posts, Medium Posts, LinkedIn posts?
Not really actively posting on any of those platforms currently, but maybe when I grow a little
more confidence in my story telling / article writing skills I will give it a gander?
Well, that is the hope at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have stuck around to the end of this post thank you! You are very kind and
I hope this gave you some sort of insight into my future plans, thank you for your
time ðŸ˜Š&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Brandon McIntyre</name></author><category term="Annoucement" /><category term="Announcement" /><category term="Special" /><summary type="html">This marks the first offical post on my personal website.
