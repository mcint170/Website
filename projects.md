The following are projects that were apart of course work or were personally
pursued on my own.

_Please Note:_  
Currently there are more course realted projects than personal projects. However,
now that my current classes are covering the fundamentals of Data Science and Machine 
Learning, I hope to dive more into personal projects. My goal is to use my recently
aquired knowledge outside of the classroom to pursue novel projects.
