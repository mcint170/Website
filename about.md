The name is Brandon McIntyre. I am an apsiring Data Scientist with quite a thirst for knowledge.
When not eating ramen and doing school work, I am on youtube learning cool new things. 
My interests outside of Data Science include:

- Linux / System Adminstration
- Quantum Mechanics 
- Mobile Technology and Trends
- Philisophy 
- Earth Science
