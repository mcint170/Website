The name is Brandon McIntyre. I am an aspiring Data Scientist with an 
insatiable appetite for learning. When not cooking delicious food or doing 
school work, I am on YouTube learning and trying out cool new things. 


My current interests outside of Data Science include:

- Linux / System Adminstration
- Quantum Mechanics 
- Mobile Technology and Trends
- Cognitive Philisophy 
- Musical Performance

On my long and continuous quest for knowledge acquisition. I have taken many 
paths and am always in search of new ones. I never let down the opportunity to 
grow my experinces in vastly wild different things. To give a little flavor of
that, I wanted to share just a few of the cool things I have done so far.

- Played the trumpet pretty seriously at one point, with solo performances in
jazz bands, ensembles, and concert bands. Won awards for best performer in the
band on a couple of occasions.
- Worked on a film entitled "Answering the Call" that was about a World War II
solider named Zenneth Arthur Pond, that won awards by the Michigan Govener's 
office and Michigan Historical Society.
- Found the missing Jackson Junior College fightsong in an archive. 
That was later was recomposed as the current Jackson College fightsong that I got
to play in the first professional recording of.
- Worked as an electrical engineer intern for a year and half at Orion Egineering.
Learning all about power tranmission and transformers in commerical plants.
- Researched and simulated Type IIp Supernovea events on the Super computer at
Michigan State Universit during my time as a Astrophysics major.
- Was the Director of Studio for a Student orgnaization called "Design for 
America" that's primary focus was creating social impact through Human Centered
Design.
